			<h4>Lighting and Watering Status 25 September 2015</h4>

			<p>Update on lighting situation. The two primary causes of light failures have been broken fixtures from the ride-along mowers, and 35 yr old wiring failures at random locations throughout the village.</p></br>

			<p>We are planning to upgrade/replace the lighting in the village in the short term but first we have to test out replacement lights to determine if they will solve the major problem, avoiding damage from ride-along lawnmowers, as well as provide the necessary light coverage using new technology LED flood/spot lights to enable us to achieve major power savings. In addition, the underground wiring may need to be replaced once the issue of getting new wires under driveways is resolved, no easy task and a significant HOA budget item.</p></br>

			<p>The four in-ground “Well lights” we ordered for test and trials arrived 9/25. We will install them on three different tree configurations and if they provide the replacement light value needed, we then will estimate the cost to install new wiring throughout the village and to install the new in-ground “Well” lights. These lights install in the ground and their armored grid covering the lens will be at ground/dirt level to prevent breaking by the mowers.</p></br>

			<p>Landscape watering. Late last summer I realized that the drought had reached the emergency level and began investigation as to how our village could begin to save water. First a Water Audit was requested and approved by the Desert Water Agency, our water supplier, and was performed in late September 2014. Based on the results of that Audit, DWA agreed to provide us with new, Smart Controllers for our landscape watering. These were installed at no cost to us in October 2014 along with remote environmental sensors to automatically optimize the watering.</p></br>

			<p>Then in early 2015 the mandate came down from the State of California through Riverside County to the City of Palm Springs for mandatory water savings of 30% for all residential and commercial/associations. To do this we had to program the Smart Controllers for a 30% reduction which was achieved beginning in April-May. In addition, watering restrictions were implemented to permit association and residential watering only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, as dictated by the City and DWA, from midnight to 7am and 7pm to midnight on those days. We complied knowing the grass would be seriously effected. Further, DWA and the City of Palm Springs forbid the “overseeding” normally done every fall to replenish lawns that requires above normal water usage. Also it was forbidden by the City to refill swimming pools until after October 1, 2015.</p></br>

			<p>On Monday, August 17, I worked with Mishael to increase the water time from 2 to 4 min per cycle (it was 3 min per cycle last year). Then on September 3 we added a 4th day of watering on Sunday, violating the edicts from both DWA and the City of Palm Springs. Then again on 4 September we increased watering time to 6 minutes. But with the hottest summer on record, the hard packed ground could not absorb water as needed to reverse the issue quickly.</p></br>

			<p>Lawns can be replaced during the next “overseeding event” when permitted. The shrubs suffered but with one exception out on Escoba Drive, none have died. I personally have watered my shrubs on the north side of my patio twice to help out and they are doing fine. Having the entire watering system on one master circuit for the 3 zones is a terrible design and was done to save money 35 years ago when it was installed. Shrubs, grass and trees have different watering needs but with only one water cycle the trees never got the water they needed and many of their roots remained near or at the surface throughout the village causing other problems and issues. There are only 2 trees in the village needing replacing and both will be dealt with shortly.</p></br>

			<p>A tech support person will visit this week (28 Sep-2 Oct) to adjust the Smart Controllers to optimum settings and replace the locks on the controllers with more secure locks.</p></br>

			<p>The controllers are owned by Ridgeview Village HOA and breaking into the boxes is a serious offense that can result in a citation from the Police Department. It’s a tough time and the HOA chose the compliance route early this year to be good citizens. Hopefully this winter will see some relaxation of the “emergency drought” conditions to allow us to recover the lawns, shrubs and trees. Other major HOA’s in Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage and Indian Wells use reclaimed water and do not have the restrictions the rest of us must deal with. Many of the resort housing communities also use Colorado River water, also not under the same restrictions we have to deal with.</p></br>
