			<h4>Arborist's Findings</h4>
			<p> Here are Judy Rogers' notes from the meeting the morning of 2/4/2016 with Joe Padilla: JPTREE <a href="mailto:Padilla@gmail.com">Padilla@gmail.com</a>  Joe recommended that we all research the web site of <a href="http://www.isa-arbor.com" target="_blank">www.isa-arbor.com</a> for general information on tree care and maintenance.</p>

			<p>Joe will follow-up this initial walk-through with a more detailed inspection so some of the following information on the trees may change. He will provide a detailed report to Vern on Monday 2/8/16 with his recommendations and the cost projections for those recommendations.</p>

			<p>Because of the poor pruning practices used in the past as well as the lack of water, many of the trees are weak, infested with pests, and in poor condition.  Approximately 20 or so of the trees should be removed. These include:</p>

			<ul><h4>Trees by the back pool area:</h4>
				<li>4 bottle trees, 3 Jacaranda and 1 pepper tree</li>
			</ul>
			<ul><h4>Trees on the outside circle:</h4>
				<li>1 large ash by unit 3505. The cost is approx. $1000 to remove this tree & roots.</li> 
				<li>4 mid to small size ash trees by units 3580, 3560, 3540 & 3520.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul><h4>Trees in the inner circle:</h4>
				<li>3 mid sized ash trees curbside by unit 3537.</li> 
				<li>3 small ash trees and bottle trees behind units 1750 and 1760.</li>
				<li>1 large Pear tree too close to unit 3512.</li>
				<li>1 large pepper tree on the south side of the tennis court.</li>
				<li>1 large ash tree between the garage and house of unit 3558 &3518 (house number many be wrong).</li>
				<li>1 large ficus tree close to the side of unit 1760.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In addition, all of the Jacaranda trees should be removed over a period of time since they cannot recover from the topping which has occurred in the past.  We should rate the Jacaranda trees on a scale of 1-9 and selectively prune (over years) to remove those which are the most dangerous first.  Also paint the curb red by the south pool so cars will not park where branches could fall and cause property damage. (Approximately 25-30 Jacaranda trees in total).</p>

			<ul><h4>Suggestions for replacement trees are:</h4>
				<li>IronWood, Palo Verde, Mesquite, Japanese Oelander, Olive, etc.  Replacement cost is $100-300 depending upon size of box.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ol><h4>Suggestions for Preventative Maintenance include:</h4>
				<li>Do not allow any future tree topping or unsupervised pruning.</li>
				<li>Apply insecticide every 3 months such as Merit or Mallot.  Leave a few damaged trees without insecticide so insects will not move to healthy trees.</li>
				<li>Ensure that lawn mowers do not touch the base of any trees.</li>
				<li>Fertilize every 3 months with a fertilizer appropriate for specific trees such as 15-15-15.</li>
				<li>Water heavily after fertilizer is applied.</li>
				<li>Gardeners tools/pruners should be soaked in lysol after use on each unit so as not to spread pests/disease from tree to tree or plant to plant.</li>
				<li>Remove trees with sun scalding of trunks.</li>
				<li>Remove oleander shrubs with any signs of pest damage.</li>
				<li>Do not top or flat cut shrubs.</li>
				<li>Palms can be watered only 1/month while temperatures are under 100 degrees.</li>
				<li>Cover exposed tree roots with soil/mulch/crushed granite etc. to prevent further damage.</li>  
				<li>Fix the irrigation system.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Joe also offered the following client as a recommendation:  Pastor David at the Our Savior Lutheran Church where he has completed a landscaping project.</p>
